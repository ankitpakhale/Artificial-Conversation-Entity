        "Hashing is an algorithm that calculates a fixed-size bit string value from a file. A file basically contains blocks of data. Hashing transforms this data into a far shorter fixed-length value or key which represents the original string. The hash value can be considered the distilled summary of everything within that file.\nA good hashing algorithm would exhibit a property called the avalanche effect, where the resulting hash output would change significantly or entirely even when a single bit or byte of data within a file is changed. A hash function that does not do this is considered to have poor randomization, which would be easy to break by hackers.\nA hash is usually a hexadecimal string of several characters. Hashing is also a unidirectional process so you can never work backwards to get back the original data."

        "One main use of hashing is to compare two files for equality. Without opening two document files to compare them word-for-word, the calculated hash values of these files will allow the owner to know immediately if they are different.\nHashing is also used to verify the integrity of a file after it has been transferred from one place to another, typically in a file backup program like SyncBack. To ensure the transferred file is not corrupted, a user can compare the hash value of both files. If they are the same, then the transferred file is an identical copy.\nIn some situations, an encrypted file may be designed to never change the file size nor the last modification date and time (for example, virtual drive container files). In such cases, it would be impossible to tell at a glance if two similar files are different or not, but the hash values would easily tell these files apart if they are different.\n"

        "As per the Supreme Court Judgement in the Aadhaar case (494 of 2012), residents are no longer required to mandatorily verify Bank account with Aadhaar. PAN Aadhaar linking is mandatory. A resident can voluntarily use his Aadhaar number in physical or electronic form by way of authentication or offline verification, or in such other form as may be specified by UIDAI. Mandatory Aadhaar authentication can be performed if the purpose is backed by law or it is in State interest. However, for availing subsidies, benefits, services beneficiaries are required to undergo mandatory Aadhaar authentication. when you link your bank account, demat account, mutual fund account, PAN, etc., with Aadhaar, you secure yourself because no one can impersonate you to avail these services. Often the fraudsters carry out transactions and transfer money from someone else\u2019s account to their accounts and go untraced as they generally submit their fake identities to the bank while opening their accounts. They operate bank accounts in fictitious names/companies and run shell companies\u2019 accounts to carry out money laundering or stash black money. Therefore, when all the bank accounts are verified with Aadhaar then it would not be possible for these unscrupulous elements to go untraced and banking as a whole would become more safe and secure as the identity of each bank account holders is established uniquely beyond doubt through eKYC. As of now 96 crore bank accounts out of total 110 crore accounts have been linked to Aadhaar.\nAt the same time, you also contribute to serve the vital national interests by making the system rid of bogus, fakes and duplicates who could misuse IDs to evade taxes, siphon off public money, etc. Through use of Aadhaar and other process improvements, the Government has been able to weed out more than 6 crore fakes, duplicates and ghosts beneficiaries and save more than Rs. 90,000 crore of public money. Also, ghost and shell entities and companies used to be created for tax evasion, money laundering, terror financing, etc. Verification of identity through Aadhaar has helped curb these practices. Similarly, use of Aadhaar has checked unscrupulous elements that used to resort to impersonation in various examination and tests for college admission and jobs, etc., and thereby denying the genuine candidates of their rightful dues. There are number of other areas where verification of identity through Aadhaar has brought in fairness and transparency in the system.\n"

        "Just like by merely knowing your bank account number, one cannot withdraw money from your account, similarly by merely knowing your Aadhaar number, no one can withdraw money from Aadhaar linked bank account. As in bank for withdrawing money, your signature, debit card, PIN, OTP, etc., is required, similarly for withdrawing money from your Aadhaar linked bank account through Aadhaar, your fingerprint, IRIS or OTP sent to your Aadhaar registered mobile will be required. No Aadhaar holder has suffered any financial or other loss or identity theft on account of any said misuse or attempted impersonation of Aadhaar. Notably, everyday more than 3 crore Authentications are carried out on the Aadhaar platform. In the last eight years, so far more than 3,012.5 crore authentications (till 28th May 2019) have been successfully done. UIDAI keeps upgrading and reviewing its security systems and safety mechanisms to make Aadhaar more secure and more useable. There has not been a single instance of biometric data breach from Aadhaar database. Therefore, people should freely use and give Aadhaar to prove their identity as and when required under the provisions of the Aadhaar Act, 2016."

It\u2019s just like any other identity document such as passport, voter ID, PAN card, ration card, driving license, etc., that you have been using freely for decades with service providers. Aadhaar identity, instead, is instantly verifiable and hence more trusted. Also, as per the Aadhaar Act 2016, the Aadhaar card is required to be verified\u00a0 either by in physical or electronic formby way of authentication or offline verification, or in such other form as may be specified. Verification is done through fingerprint, iris scan, OTP authentication, and QR code etc. Hence, it is near impossible to impersonate you if you use Aadhaar to prove your identity. People have been freely giving other identity documents such as passport, voter ID, PAN card, ration card, driving license, etc. But did they stop using these documents for the fear that somebody would use them to impersonate? No! They continue using them and if any fraud happens, the law enforcement agencies handle them as per law. The same logic will apply to Aadhaar. In fact, Aadhaar is more secure than many other identity documents, because unlike other IDs, Aadhaar is instantly verifiable through biometric and OTP authentication and QR code. Further, under the Aadhaar Act, 2016 stringent penalties, including fines and imprisonment are provided whenever a person misuses your Aadhaar number or tries to cause any harm to you."

        "One Aadhaar: Aadhaar is a unique number, and no resident can have a duplicate number since it is linked to their individual biometrics; thereby identifying fake and ghost identities which result in leakages today. Savings from eliminating duplicates and fakes through Aadhaar-based identification will further enable governments to expand benefits to other eligible residents.\nPortability: Aadhaar is a universal number, and agencies and services can contact the central Unique Identification database from anywhere in the country to authenticate a beneficiary's identity by availing authentication services.\nInclusion of those without any existing identity documents: A problem in reaching benefits to poor and marginalized residents is that they often lack the identification documents they need to receive State benefits; the \"Introducer\" system which has been approved for data verification for the UIDAI will enable such residents to establish an identity.\nElectronic benefit transfers: The UID-enabled-Bank-Account network will offer a secure and low cost platform to directly remit benefits to residents without the heavy costs associated today with benefit distribution; the leakages in the current system will also be stemmed as a result.\nAadhaar-based authentication to confirm entitlement delivered to the beneficiary: The UIDAI will offer online authentication services for agencies who wish to validate a resident's identity; this service will enable confirmation of the entitlement actually reaching the intended beneficiary. Improved services through increased transparency: Clear accountability and transparent monitoring would significantly improve access and quality of entitlements to beneficiaries and the agency alike.\nSelf-service puts residents in control: Using Aadhaar as an authentication mechanism, residents should be able to access up-to-date information about their entitlements, demand services and redress their grievances directly from their mobile phone, kiosks or other means. In the case of self-service on the resident's mobile, security is assured using two-factor authentication (i.e. by proving possession of the resident's registered Mobile Number and knowledge of the resident's Aadhaar PIN). These standards are compliant with the Reserve Bank of India's approved standards for Mobile Banking and Payments.\n"

        "Protection of the individual, and the safeguarding their information is inherent in the design of the UID project. From having a random number which does not reveal anything about the individual to other features listed below, the UID project keeps the interest of the resident at the core of its purpose and objectives.\nCollecting limited information: Data collected by the UIDAI is purely to issue Aadhaar, and confirm the identity of Aadhaar holders. The UIDAI is collecting basic data fields in order to be able to establish identity this includes Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Address, Parent/ Guardian's name essential for children but not for others, mobile number and email id is optional as well . The UIDAI is collecting biometric information to establish uniqueness therefore collecting photo, 10 finger prints and iris.\nNo profiling and tracking information collected: The UIDAI policy bars it from collecting sensitive personal information such as religion, caste, community, class, ethnicity, income and health. The profiling of individuals is therefore not possible through the UID system, since the data collected is limited to that required for identification and identity confirmation. The UIDAI had in fact, dropped the place of birth data field part of the initial list of information it planned to collect based on feedback from CSOs that it could lead to profiling. The UIDAI also does not collect any transaction records of the individual. The records of an individual confirming their identity through Aadhaar will only reflect that such a confirmation happened. This limited information will be retained for a short period time in the interest of the resident, to resolve any disputes.\nRelease of information - yes or no response: The UIDAI is barred from revealing personal information in Aadhaar database the only response permitted is yes or no to requests to verify an identity The only exceptions are the order of a High court , or the order of a secretary, in case of national security . This is a reasonable exception and is clear and precise. This approach is also in line with security norms followed in US and Europe on access to data in case of a security threat.\nData protection and privacy: The UIDAI has the obligation to ensure the security and confidentiality of the data collected . The data will be collected on software provided by the UIDAI and encrypted to prevent leaks in transit. Trained and certified enrollers will collect the information, who will not have access to the data being collected. The UIDAI has a comprehensive security policy to ensure the safety and integrity of its data. It will publish more details on this, including the Information Security Plan and Policies for the CIDR and mechanisms for auditing the compliance of the UIDAI and its contracting agencies. In addition, there will be strict security and storage protocols in place. Penalties for any security violation will be severe, and include penalties for disclosing identity information . There are penal consequences for unauthorised access to CIDR including hacking , and penalties for tampering with data in the CIDR under the Aadhaar Act, 2016 .\nConvergence and linking of UIDAI information to other databases: The UID database is not linked to any other databases, or to information held in other databases. Its only purpose will be to verify a person's identity at the point of receiving a service, and that too with the consent of Aadhaar holder. The UID database will be guarded both physically and electronically by a few select individuals with high clearance. It will not be available even for many members of the UID staff and will be secured with the best encryption, and in a highly secure data vault. All access details will be properly logged.\n"

From having a random number which does not reveal anything about the individual to other features listed below, the UID project keeps the interest of the resident at the core of its purpose and objectives.\n\n\u2022 Collecting limited information\nThe UIDAI is collecting only basic data fields - Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Address, Parent/ Guardian\u2019s (name essential for children but not for others) photo, 10 finger prints and iris scan.\n\u2022 No profiling and tracking information collected\nThe UIDAI policy bars it from collecting sensitive personal information such as religion, caste, community, class, ethnicity, income and health. The profiling of individuals is therefore not possible through the UID system.\n\u2022 Release of information \u2013 yes or no response\nThe UIDAI will not reveal personal information in the Aadhaar database \u2013 the only response will be a \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 to requests to verify an identity\n\u2022 Convergence and linking of UIDAI information to other databases\nThe UID database is not linked to any other databases, or to information held in other databases. Its only purpose will be to verify a person\u2019s identity at the point of receiving a service, and that too with the consent of the aadhaar number holder\nThe UID database will be guarded both physically and electronically by a few select individuals with high clearance. The data will be secured with the best encryption, and in a highly secure data vault. All access details will be properly logged.\n"

        "In order to Link Aadhaar with PAN, ideally your demographic details (i.e. Name, Gender and Date of Birth) should match in both the documents.\nIn case of any minor mismatch in Aadhaar Name provided by taxpayer when compared to the actual data in Aadhaar, One Time Password (Aadhaar OTP) will be sent to the mobile registered with Aadhaar. Taxpayers should ensure that the date of birth and gender in PAN and Aadhaar are exactly same.\nIn a rare case where Aadhaar name is completely different from name in PAN, then the linking will fail and taxpayer will be prompted to change the name in either Aadhaar or in PAN database.\nNote:\nFor PAN data update related queries you may visit: https://www.utiitsl.com.\nFor Aadhaar update related information you may visit UIDAI official website: www.uidai.gov.in\nIn-case linking problem still persists you are requested to visit Income Tax official website or call IT department helpline.\n\n"

        "\u2022 Make sure that the resident has original documents for verification. In instances where original documents are not available, copies attested / certified by a public notary / gazetted officer will be accepted.\n\u2022 The documents produced by the resident for Aadhaar enrolment/Update must be in the list of approved documents only.\n\u2022 The format is for certificate to be issued by officials/ institutions (only those that are recognised in the UIDAI\u2019s valid list of documents) for Proof of Identity and Address is as per Appendix A/B.\n\u2022 Verifier can refuse verification, if they suspect forged/altered documents. In cases where Verifier refuses verification of the documents produced, reasons should be recorded in brief by the Verifier on the Enrolment Form.\n\u2022 In case the Verifier refuses verification with reasons or turns the resident back without recording any reasons, the resident can approach a designated Authority created by the Registrar at the Block level for Grievance Redressal.\n\u2022 Verify Name, Date of Birth, Address, and Relationship Details against PoI, DoB, PoA, PoR, respectively.\no Name\no PoI requires a document containing the resident\u2019s name and photograph. Verify that supporting document has both.\no If any of the PoI document submitted does not contain the photograph of the resident, then it will not be accepted as a valid PoI. In order to be inclusive and free of harassment, documents with older photographs are acceptable.\no Confirm the name in the document by asking the resident his/her name. This is to ensure that the resident is providing own documents.\no The name of the person should be entered in full. It should not include salutations or titles like Mr., Miss, Mrs., Major, Retd., Dr. etc\n\u2022 It is very important to write the person\u2019s name very carefully and correctly. For example, the respondent may tell that his name is V. Vijayan whereas his full name may be VenkatramanVijayan and similarly R. K. Srivastava\u2019s full name may actually be Ramesh Kumar Srivastava. Similarly, a female enrollee may tell her name as K. S. K. Durga while her full name may be Kalluri Surya Kanaka Durga. Ascertain from her/him the expansion of her/his initials and check the same in the documentary evidence produced.\n\u2022 In case of difference in the name declared and the one in document (PoI) is limited to spelling and/or sequence of first, middle and last name, the name as declared by the resident may be recorded .\n\u2022 If two documentary proofs produced by the enrollee have variation in the same name (i.e., with initials and full name), the enrollee\u2019s full name should be recorded.\n\u2022 Sometimes the infants and children may not have been named yet. Try to ascertain the intended name for the child by explaining to the enrollee the importance of capturing the name of the individual for allotting UID. In case of non availability of supporting documents for PoI, the name should be recorded with the assistance of the Introducer\n\u2022 Date Of Birth (DOB):\no Date of birth of Resident must indicate day, month and year in the relevant field.\no If the Resident provides documentary evidence of Date of Birth, then the Date of Birth is considered as \u201cVerified\u201d.

The software will automatically calculate year of birth in such case.\no The Verifier should check the entry in the Enrolment/Update Form and ensure that the resident has correctly indicated the date of birth as \u201cverified\u201d/\u201ddeclared\u201d or has filled his/her Age.\n\u2022 Residential Address:\no Verify that the PoA contains the name and address. The Verifier should ensure that the name in the PoA document matches with the name in the PoI document. A difference in the name in PoI and PoA document is acceptable if the difference is only in spelling and/or sequence of first, middle and last name.\no The \u201ccare of\u201d person\u2019s name, if any, is usually captured for children and old age people living with parents and children, respectively. If not available, one can leave this Address line blank.\no Enhancement of address is allowed. The resident may be allowed to add minor fields such as House No., Lane No., Street Name, correcting typographic errors, minor changes/ corrections to pin code etc. to the address listed in the PoA as long as these additions/modifications do not alter the base address mentioned in the PoA document\no If the changes requested in Address Enhancement are substantial and change the base address that is listed in the PoA, the resident will be required to produce an alternate PoA or enrol through an Introducer.\n\u2022 Relationship Details:\no In the case of children below 5 years, \u201cName\u201d and \u201cAadhaar Number\u201d of one of the parents or guardian is mandatory. Parent/Guardian must produce their Aadhaar letter when enrolling children (or they can be Enroled together).\no In the case of an adult, no verification will be done for the information on parent or spouse. They are recorded for internal purposes only.\n\u2022 Head of Family(HoF):\no Verify that the PoR document establishes relation between the Head of Family and the family member. Only those family members can be Enroled based on the relationship document (PoR), whose names are recorded on relationship document.\no Head of Family must always accompany the family member when the family member is getting Enroled.\no The verifier must also check the HoF details in the Enrolment/ Update Form in case of HoF based verification. HoF\u2019s Name and Aadhaar Number in form should be verified against the Aadhaar letter.\no Ensure that in case of HoF based enrolments, the relationship details mentioned in the form are of the HoF only.\n\u2022 Mobile Number, Email address:\n\nIf the enrollee possesses and is willing to provide his/her Mobile Number and / or Email Address, these optional fields must be filled in. Verifier can inform the importance of these fields to the resident. UIDAI can get in touch with the resident using this information, if required, like in case of returned letters.\n"

Fields that are good in original enrolment are not to be retyped during Correction.\n\u2022 The correction in data will be reviewed with the resident and any one of the biometrics of the resident (provided in drop down menu on client) will also be taken to confirm that the resident is OK with corrections.\n\u2022 In case the resident is child below 5 years, the biometric of the parent/guardian whose details are entered in the relationship fields, will be taken. The Operator will sign off the enrolment and Supervisor, Introducer sign off will be required in biometric exceptions and Introducer based verification respectively.\n\u2022 An acknowledgement of correction will be printed at the end of correction process along with the Resident\u2019s photo. The acknowledgement of correction will be signed by Operator and handed over to Resident. The consent will be signed by the resident and filed by the Operator along with the other documents of the resident.\n"

        "Biometric Data Capture Guidelines:\n\u2022 Check resident\u2019s eyes and fingers for fitness (missing/amputated). If the resident has any deformities due to which it is not possible to take fingerprints/iris, these also have to be captured as a biometric exception.\n\u2022 Check and indicate Biometric Exceptions in the software, only where applicable. Do not mark biometric exceptions where biometrics can be captured. It will be treated as \u2018fraud\u2019 and invite strictest penalty.\n\u2022 In case of Biometric exception, always take the Exception photograph of the resident showing resident\u2019s face and both hands, irrespective of the type of exception.\n\u2022 The enrolee may not be in a position to keep herself / himself in correct posture for reaching biometric instruments or for photograph due to old age or sickness. In such cases the operator should arrange to take the biometric data by moving the equipment close to the enrolee.\n\u2022 If the finger/iris of the resident has a temporary damage and it is not possible to capture the biometric, the Operator will record it in exceptions. The resident should later get his/her biometric updated.\n\u2022 Capture Biometrics - Facial Image, IRIS and Fingerprints for all the residents above 5 years in age.\n\u2022 In case of any children who are below 5 years in age, only Facial Image and any one parent\u2019s Biometric Confirmation is captured.\n\n\nGuidelines for Facial Image Capture\n\u2022 Enrolee Position: For capturing facial image, it is advisable for the operator to adjust the camera instead of the Enrolee to position herself/himself at the right distance or in the right posture. Frontal pose needs to be captured i.e. no head rotation or tilt. The resident should be instructed to be seated properly with their back upright and their face towards the camera.\n\u2022 Focus: The capture device should use auto focus and auto-capture functions. The output image should not suffer from motion blur, over or under exposure, unnatural colored lighting, and distortion.\n\u2022 Expression: Expression strongly affects the performance of automatic face recognition and also affects accurate visual inspection by humans. It is strongly recommended that the face should be captured with neutral (non-smiling) expression, teeth closed, and both eyes open and looking into the camera.\n\u2022 Illumination: Poor illumination has a high impact on the performance of face recognition. Proper and equally distributed lighting mechanism should be used such that there are no shadows over the face, no shadows in eye sockets, and no hot spots. No light exactly above the enrolee should be used since it can cause shadows. Light should be diffused and placed in front of the enrolee so that there are no shadows under the eye.\n\u2022 Eye Glasses: If the person normally wears glasses, it is recommended that the photograph be taken with glasses. However, the glasses should be clear and transparent. Dark glasses /tinted glasses should be taken off before taking the photograph.\n\u2022 Accessories: Use of accessories that cover any region of the face is not permitted. For example, women in purdah would have to reveal the full face before the photograph is taken. Similarly women in Ghoonghat would have to clearly reveal the full face before the photograph can be captured. The head may remain covered but the full face contour should be visible.\n\u2022 Further, accessories like turban/head gear are also allowed as religious/ traditional practices.\n\u2022 However, accessories like eye patches are allowed due to medical reasons. This would also mean an exception needs to be recorded for Iris, because only one Iris can be captured.\n\u2022 Operators need to be trained to obtain the best possible face images that satisfy requirements. Even if the quality flag is green but the Operator is able to judge that a better picture can be taken, then same should be attempted. However, it should be borne in mind that recapture should not become harassment for the resident.\n\u2022 For children, it is acceptable that the child sits on parent\u2019s laps, but it needs to be ensured that parent\u2019s face is not captured along with child\u2019s face. The background may get rejected due to non white screen in case of children but two faces should not get captured in one picture.\n\u2022 Actionable feedback needs to be checked for captures that fail. Some of the actionable feedbacks in software are:\no No face Found\no Enrolee too far\no Enrolee too close (eye distance in input image is greater than one third of image width)\no Pose (Look Straight)\no Insufficient lighting\no Very low face confidence (faceless, object not identified as human face)\no Non-uniform lighting (of face in output image)\no Incorrect background (in output image)\no Insufficient lighting (bad gray values in face area of output image)\n\u2022 If any biometric exceptions have been specified on the demographic screen, these should be captured as photographs on the Photograph screen.\n\u2022 Only facial image is captured for children below 5 years. Iris and fingerprint screens will not get activated for children below 5 years\n\n\nGuidelines for Capturing Fingerprints\n\u2022 The images of all the ten fingers are to be captured. The fingerprints must be captured in the sequence of slaps of four fingers of left hand, right hand followed by the two thumbs.\n\u2022 The fingers have to be positioned correctly on the platen to enable capture. There should be no direct light shining on the platen. Use the Indicators on fingerprint devices for positioning of fingers. The fingers should be placed in right direction on the device. Please consult the manufacturer manual incase of any doubt or else consult the supervisor.\n\u2022 Use a lint free cloth periodically to clean the platen of the finger print device for good finger print capture\n\u2022 Check devices periodically for scratches, out of focus images, only partial images getting captured. In case any such problem is noticed, then report to your Supervisor/HQ and request for change of equipment.\n\u2022 Fingerprints cut off, wet/smudged fingerprint; very light prints due to insufficient pressure will result in poor quality. The resident\u2019s hands should be clean (no mud, oil etc.). Ask resident to wash hands with water and soap, if necessary.\n\u2022 The fingers should not be excessively dry or wet. Moisten with a wet cloth or dry finger with a dry cloth\n\u2022 The Enrollee should be requested to place all four fingers of the left hand/right hand/two thumbs to platen of the fingerprint scanner for the four-finger capture to ensure good contact and maximize the area of the captured fingerprints. Ensure that the fingers are placed flat and till the top joint of the finger is placed well on the scanner. The top of the fingers should be within the platen area and not outside the defined area.\n\u2022 If automatic capture does not happen, the operator should force the capture when force capture tab is enabled in the enrolment software.\n\u2022 The operator should check the actionable feedback when capture fails. Some actionable feedbacks provided by software are:\no Number of fingers present does not match with expected number of fingers\no Finger not positioned correctly\no Too much Pressure (duty cycle)\no Too little pressure\no Central region missing\no Excessive moisture (wetness)\no Excessive dryness\n\u2022 The operator should visually check the image for quality and for typical problems. In case there are problems go back to steps above to retry the capture.\n\u2022 When image quality is pass or if maximum number of captures are exhausted, move on to the next step\n\u2022 Fingerprints are best captured in standing position\n\u2022 In case of additional fingers, ignore the additional finger and capture the main five fingers.\n\u2022 Make sure your own fingerprints do not get mixed with the resident\u2019s fingerprints. Operators can carefully put small pressure on the resident\u2019s fingers to capture the fingerprints but always make sure not to mix your own fingerprints.\n\n\nGuidelines for Capturing Iris\n\u2022 The operator and not the Enrollee will handle the capture device, generally.\n\u2022 Children can be told that it is like taking photos/pictures so that they are not apprehensive.\n\u2022 The Enrollee will be required to sit in a fixed position, like taking a portrait photograph.\n\u2022 The software is able to measure the iris image quality. An initial image quality assessment would be done to provide feedback to the operator during the capture process. The software alerts the operator with actionable feedbacks, if the captured iris image is of insufficient quality. Some actionable feedbacks provided by software are:\no Occlusion(significant part of iris is not visible)\no Iris not in focus\no Gaze incorrect(resident looking away)\no Pupil dilation\n\u2022 The iris capture process is sensitive to ambient light. No direct or artificial light should directly reflect off Enrolee\u2019s eyes.\n\u2022 The device should be held steady. In case device requires to be held by resident, the enrolment operator/supervisor may help the resident to hold the device steady.\n\u2022 Table light used for facial image capture should be switched off during iris capture. Direct sunlight or any other bright light shining on resident\u2019s eye will create reflections and result in poor quality image.\n\u2022 Operator must instruct the resident to look straight into the camera, open eyes wide open (one easy way to do this is to ask the resident look angry or stare) and do not blink during iris capture. Resident has to be stationary.\n\u2022 If resident is experiencing difficulty during Iris scan and recapture is required, then the operator may navigate to next screen to capture other details and then return to Iris capture. This will relax the resident from constant pressure to keep eyes wide open during iris capture.\n\u2022 The Operator needs to be patient during capture and wait for the device response instead of scrolling, navigating back and forth on screen.\n"

EA must make sure that the Operators and Supervisors are of age 18 years and above. The Operator should be minimum 10+2 pass and should be comfortable using computer. The Supervisor should be minimum 10+2 pass and preferably a Graduate and should have a good understanding and experience in using a computer.\nEA must ensure compliance to Labour laws and all statutory provisions in various Labour regulations that is PF, ESI, Industrial Disputes Act, Contract Labour Act and Minimum Wages Act etc.\nThe personnel should be given mandatory induction training on the various activities and equipment and gadgets involved/used in the enrolment process and resident enrolment, transliteration skills in local language, to enable them to understand and adjust to the local situation. The mandatory induction training shall be compulsory before deployment of the personnel. The EA will inform concerned RO Regional Offices of UIDAI prior to training schedule and will also give a follow-up report.\nThe enrolment agency shall ensure the availability of the requisite infrastructure for imparting training as per UIDAI guidelines The Operators and Supervisors should have obtained certificate from a testing and certifying agency authorized by UIDAI. Ensure correct certification as per specific roles. A certified Operator cannot work as a Supervisor.\nPayments to operators and supervisors should be made preferably to their bank accounts.\n3. Enrol Operator/Supervisors and Register and Activate them at UIDAI\nOperator /Supervisors must have their Aadhaar numbers generated and certification test passed for getting activated in accordance with UIDAI guidelines prior to commencing enrolments. Do not deploy them for enrolment without the fulfilment of these mandatory requirements.\nEA admin user must use unique user IDs for activating their Operator/ Supervisors. Do not use one password for multiple set of Operator IDs. Ensure all details entered are correct on UIDAI technology portal and certification agency\u2019s portal and there is no mismatch.\nEA must ensure availability of manpower activated in accordance with Aadhaar guidelines prior to commencing enrolments.\nEAs will have to demonstrate that they have certified the active operators, requisite machines and hardware available to be deployed. EAs will have to declare enrolment station deployment plans i.e. when and where the centers will be established. EAs will also demonstrate that they have the requisite supervision infrastructure available. Based on this information, ROs will assess the preparedness of the Registrars and EAs and may then allow the on-boarding of stations.\n4. Get established as an Enrolment Agency at UIDAI\nThe EA must receive their EA code from UIDAI\nThe EA must ask the Registrar to establish the link between them (Attach EA) at UIDAI\nReceive admin password for portal and auth code for client registration from UIDAI\nObtain SFTP account setup and password\n5. Ensure that Pin code data for planned enrolment locations is checked in Pin Master of Aadhaar software, and is correct and complete. Review and Report missing/incorrect Pin codes and use Pin code correction process for getting the Pin Numbers corrected.\n6. Software Installation, Configuration and Registration\nThe latest version of Aadhaar Enrolment software client needs to be installed, configured and registered with CIDR. The Enrolment Agency needs Auth User and Auth Code from UIDAI technology team to register its clients.\nThe person performing the system configuration is typically a representative of the Registrar. Normally the Registrar may ask the EA to perform the installation and configuration. In such a case, the configuration and registration may be done in presence of Registrar\u2019s representatives.\nLoad and test Pre-enrolment data on enrolment centre laptops / desktops and ensure it is accessible / searchable.\nAll latest Master Data such as Pin code, Operator credentials, list of documents etc. should be loaded on client\nThorough testing of Aadhaar client working in integration with pre-enrolment data and KYR+ applications, along with local language support, pin code and master data availability\nEnsure all Registered stations are active at UIDAI\nEnsure Operator/Supervisor/Introducer (OSI) are on boarded on the enrolment stations\n7. EA must ensure with Registrar that Aadhaar and KYR+ Enrolment Forms are printed, ready for distribution/distributed to residents. If enrolment forms are distributed and filled in advance, it will help speed up enrolment at the Centre. The enrolment forms can be used as a tool for crowd management by controlled distribution.\nThe print and paper quality of forms should be ensured as the forms will be stored as per Document Management System.\n8. Setting up of Enrolment Centre(EC) and Enrolment Stations (ES)\nEA will assist Registrar in developing enrolment schedules. EA will work with the Registrar in identification of suitable enrolment centres at scheduled locations. Once EC are identified, EA must ensure readiness of the EC as per the latest Enrolment Centre Setup Checklist (Annexure 1). The Enrolment Centre Setup Checklist by UIDAI enlists the various requirements at Enrolment Centre and Station level and is to facilitate the EA in planning.\nEnsure adequate stationary like paper for printing and other logistics are available at centre\nEnsure adequate power and other backup arrangement at enrolment centre\nDeploy Hardware, Software for Enrolment. Working of all equipment and application at every station must be tested.\nEA must not undertake enrolment operations at locations without valid agreement with the Registrars.\nThe Enrolment Agencies also need to fill the Enrolment Centre details at UIDAI portal.\nEA must adhere to Safety Procedures, Rules, Regulations, & Restrictions and shall comply with the provisions of all laws including safety and labour laws, rules, regulations and notifications issued there under from time to time. EA shall take all measures necessary or proper to protect the personnel and facilities and shall observe all reasonable safety rules and instructions.\n9. Contact Centre information filled\nEA must fill the forms with information required by UIDAI Contact Centre and submit. This information pertains to EA contacts at EC, Enrolment Centre address and working hours etc.\n10. Help Create Awareness\nEnrolment Agency needs to work with the Registrar in communication and generating resident awareness at grass root level. Prior to the commencement of the Enrolment operations the Enrolment Agency shall work closely with the local governing bodies, key introducers in publicizing the Aadhaar, its importance and schedule for Aadhaar registration in that location. EA must prominently display important information relating to consent and operator responsibilities inside the enrolment centres.\nThe role of the enrolment agency should be limited to publicising the content provided by the UIDAI/ Registrars. The EA should not add to / modify /delete the content provided by Registrar/ UIDAI.\n"

        " high level summary of various roles and responsibilities of Registrar are:.\n1. Enrolment Planning\nAs a part of the Enrolment Planning workshop, the Registrar is advised to finalize the targeted enrolment nos., locations to be covered and timelines for the same. This data can in turn be used to plan the no. of Enrolment Stations needed, locations for the same, devices needed, operators to be staffed etc.\nRegistrars will also decide enrolment approach (phased, sweep etc). It is strongly recommended that the Registrar enrol all residents of the locality and not limit it to their beneficiaries/ customers. \u2018Sweeping\u2019 all residents will give Registrars the benefits of economies of scale and optimizing on the cost of enrolment per resident.\nFinalize plan to include marginalized/vulnerable communities & areas for CSO involvement. Special enrolment drives should be initiated by registrars in consultation with ROs for the underprivileged, various vulnerable groups and disabled persons.\nIdentify area of interest for Aadhaar-enabled applications. Identify govt remittances which can be routed through Aadhaar-enabled Bank accounts. Registrars should link their UID enrolment activities to their core programs and citizen centric service delivery.\nRegistrar will work with the UIDAI to identify Banks to partner with for Financial Inclusion solution. Define processes as required to implement the Financial Inclusion solution.\nAt times, Registrar\u2019s may have to hold special camps or call residents for re-enrolment like in case where EA machines get stolen or where Resident data packets are irrecoverable due to process/technology failure. Registrar must keep the EA apprised that such situations may arise and they have to be prepared for re-enrolment of residents in such cases.\nRegistrar must keep the local authorities, Introducers, Verifiers and other stakeholders informed of enrolment schedule\nIn order to start enrolments, the Registrar has to complete the following activities, many of which can run in parallel and would have commenced post the Project Initiation Workshop:\n2. Enrolment Agency Selection and On-boarding\nIdentify Enrolment Agencies (EA)\n1. Registrars may engage Enrolment Agencies for the purpose of enrolling resident into Aadhaar. Registrars will share the details of hired Enrolment Agencies with UIDAI.\n2. Registrars are advised to engage only Empanelled Enrolment Agencies. If non-empanelled agencies are engaged, they must be subject to the same terms and conditions as the empanelled agencies.\n3. New contracts should include a clause of continued empanelment mandatory for continuation of work. Model RFP/Q templates and the list of empanelled agencies have been published on UIDAI website.\n4. No Sub Contracting \u2013 Subcontracting has serious impacts on the quality and security of data. Agreement with enrolment agencies should have conditions to discourage sub-contracting. However field level manpower such as enrolment operators and supervisors can be hired through third parties. EAs should be asked to provide details of the companies from which they are going to hire this manpower.\nOnboard EA - EA Project & Technology managers need to be identified and added in JWG. Initiation Workshop for EA needs to be held by Registrar and UIDAI to provide detailed enrolment process & implementation overview.\nIdentify Enrolment Agency related requirements of EA training, device/resource capacity planning.\nProcure infrastructure and equipment including certified biometric devices as per standards defined by the UIDAI, through the designated enrolment agencies.\nIt is recommended that the Registrar must insist on Enrolment agencies using only trained operators/supervisors. All Enrolment Operators need to be tested and certified; keeping in mind the significant impact they have in collecting good quality and accurate data from residents.\n3. Enrolment Centre and Stations\nEnrolment Centers and their Location\n1. Registrar will identify and co-ordinate for suitable locations where Enrolment Centers may be setup keeping in mind law and order, terrain, local weather conditions, security, power availability, approach/access to the area and lighting. Refer Resident Enrolment Process document for Centre selection guidelines.\n2. Non-state registrars should work in coordination with ROs and state nodal departments. NSRs should also have enrolment centres only in and around their premises to ensure close supervision. Bank NSRs can also be allowed to enrol through special camps provided that they have cleared these enrolment plans with the State UIDIC &/or the State Nodal officer.\n3. Registrars should plan for setting up permanent enrolment centres. Registrars need to maintain at least a skeletal enrolment network in their respective locations, after the \u2018enrolment sweeps\u2019 are completed to facilitate on-going enrolments and updation.\nDecide Number of Stations for Each Centre\n1. The number of stations can be decided based on the target number of days for completion of enrolment in the particular area or the district and the expected number of enrolees in the area. Model RFP published on UIDAI website provides an excel sheet for facilitating calculation of number of stations.\n2. Tables, lighting, backdrops, height of table, chairs, positioning of resident and operator, and issue of direct sunlight for photo capture, all these need to be considered for enrolment station setup.\n3. Ensure Setup & registration of enrolment stations as Active production machines with UIDAI. The enrolment agencies may be asked to submit their machine deployment plans and their preparedness as per a prescribed checklist. ROs will assess the preparedness of the Registrars and EAs and may then allow the on-boarding of stations.\n4. Registrar must Review the Enrolment Centre Setup checklist with Enrolment Agency and verify if all required activities are completed.\n4. Define KYR+ fields\nThe AADHAAR Enrolment Client application captures the KYR (Know Your Resident) data. The registrars may require capturing some other registrar specific fields related to residents called as KYR+ data. For example, in case of PDS data, information such as APL (Above poverty line), BPL (Below poverty line), Family Details, etc. may be collected as part of KYR+ data. If any KYR+ fields are to be collected, define those fields and initiate technology integration with respect to data capture API and logistics. However, experience suggests that the number of fields proposed to be captured at the enrolment station must be kept at minimum as residents cannot be expected to bring multiple documents at the time of enrolment.\n5. Pre-Enrolment Data\nRegistrar may want to complete the demographic data capture and verification ahead of the biometric capture. This step is called pre-enrolment. In case where Registrar has a good database, Registrars can share this with Enrolment Agencies to pre-populate the AADHAAR Enrolment Client. This data would reduce the effort and time of the enrolment operators during data capture process at the enrolment centres during resident\u2019s presence. The details of the database need to be discussed and sent to UIDAI in advance in prescribed format and aligned to UIDAI requirements. However, pre-enrolling residents is not mandatory.\n6. Check Pin Code Master\nRegistrar must Review and get Pin code master data corrected and completed prior to start of enrolments in the region. Registrar should provide list of PIN codes to be corrected in PIN codes master to UIDAI using existing Pin Code correction process.\n7. Review list of Approved documents\nUIDAI has defined a list of valid documents to be used during Aadhaar enrolment process as Proof of Identity (PoI), Proof of Address (PoA), Proof of Relationship (PoR) and Date of Birth (DoB). However, UIDAI and Registrars have the authority to amend and enlarge the list of PoI and PoA documents in some exceptional circumstances. Registrars may add any other required document not in the list, in consultation with UIDAI Regional Office. The Enrolment Agencies will then download the master for documents in the client stations, pertaining to the Registrar, for use during enrolment.\n8. Send local language requirements\nSend local language requirements for contact centre, enrolment client (label/text, transliteration). Complete local language translation for labels, print receipts/letter in coordination UIDAI.\n9. Biometric data need of registrar identified\nRegistrars may analyse their requirement for resident data and capability to securely manage and store data. It is not necessary for Registrar to store resident\u2019s biometric data. Registrars are, instead, encouraged to adopt online authentication offered by UIDAI \u2013 this will require no local/offline storage of biometric data in registrar applications. However, if the Registrar decides to store the biometric data, then Registrar will have to share a plan to retrieve, manage and store data with UIDAI, for UIDAI to start creating Registrar data packets.\n10. Provide registrar public key for data encryption\nRegistrars must provide their public key to the UIDAI for the purpose of encrypting the EID-UID mapping file that UIDAI will share with Registrars after Aadhaar generation. Encrypting using Registrar\u2019s public key provides a layer of security and is prescribed by UIDAI for data transfer. Registrar must contact UIDAI for details on public/ private key requirements.\n11. Decryption Utility\nRegistrars must develop their own decryption utility for decrypting the EID-UID mapping file. Registrar should also successfully test file decryption.\n12. Develop Registrar Technical requirements\nRegistrar will require technical personnel/system integrators for developing their technical requirements for\nPre-enrolment data capture\nKYR+ application\nDocument storage\nRegistrar packet transfer/ management & usage\nDecryption utility\nFirst mile i.e. data transfer from Enrolment Centres to UIDAI and Registrar\nKYR+ data transfer, automating EID-UID mapping in KYR+ database\nReceiving EID-UID mapping file from CIDR. Registrar must be ready to receive and update Registrar DBs with EID-UID mapping\nOther activation and portal workflow related requirements\n13. Other Technology side Requirements\nThere are some requirements that the Registrar will need to do for integration with UIDAI database:\nGet set up as a Registrar in UIDAI database. Send requisite details in prescribed format to UIDAI.\nReceive Registrar code, login and password for technology portal and SFTP application\nThen Attach EAs on technology portal to establish Registrar \u2013 EA linkage.\nUpdate and activate Introducers list on technology portal\nReceive and download SFTP application\nDefine Location Codes \u2013 Registrar can assign location codes to each of its schedule and this code can be used by Enrolment Agency in client machines when conducting enrolments in the particular region. The assignment of location codes will help in generating enrolment reports by location code which can be helpful for payment purposes. Registrar\u2019s supervisors at Enrolment Centres will have to monitor the use of correct location codes by Enrolment Agency.\nA representative of the registrar performs the system configuration and registration once the software is installed. Normally the Registrar may ask the EA to perform the installation and configuration. In such a case, the configuration and Registration may be done in presence of Registrar\u2019s representatives and/or Registrar must regularly check the registration details on the client like location code, Registrar and EA name etc. Work flow related requirements \u2013 At times Registrar may be asked to intervene and given a role in a process workflow for example in cases where resident data packets are on hold due to specific reasons. Registrar will have to complete the given responsibility in a defined time period in such cases.\n14. Registrar software readiness and their integration to Aadhaar software\nRegistrar must check Aadhaar Application Software is ready for deployment with pincode data corrected, registrar public key and local language support included. Test Registrar\u2019s own software and their integration with Aadhaar software.\n15. Information, Education & Communication\nRegistrar will define an integrated IEC Plan & Material leveraging the content developed by the UIDAI. The UIDAI\u2019s IEC guidelines list in detail the different kinds of stakeholders to engage (PRI members, introducers, CSOs, etc.) and the recommended messages and media to use for each of them. The IEC plan lists the activities to be triggered 45/30/15/ 7 days before commencing enrolments.\nRegistrars must coordinate with UIDAI IEC team for details on their IEC responsibilities.\n16. Identify and Deploy Introducers\nRegistrars will need to identify Introducers who can help enrol beneficiaries who lack PoA/PoI documents.\nRegistrar identifies introducers region wise and prepares list by District/State in which the Introducer is authorized to work. Registrars can also leverage CSOs to better reach marginalized residents, act as Introducers, and build awareness among them to mobilize enrolments from this group. Based on inputs from UIDAI, review and finalize list of Introducers and notify the same in a public manner.\nIntroducers need to be Enroled in advance and have their Aadhaar numbers generated, registered and activated in Aadhaar database. Organize camps for enrolment of Introducers to ensure that all Introducers on the final list are Enroled into the program.\nIntroducer workshop is held to appraise them about their roles & responsibilities\nIntroducers are required to sign consent to being a Introducer which is stored by the Registrar. Introducer consent form format is provided by UIDAI. Put in place systems to ensure ongoing monitoring of the Introducer list occurs at regular intervals. Based on performance, make changes/additions to the list as required and share with UIDAI. Ensure that both UIDAI and the Registrar have most up-to-date list of Introducers at all times.\nPublicise the Introducer concept to make residents aware. Provide the resident information about acceptable Introducers. Publish list of Introducers and Verifiers at the enrolment centres along with their contact details. Detailed guidelines on Introducer selection, Introducers roles and liabilities are defined by UIDAI and published on UIDAI portal.\n17. Identify and Deploy Verifiers\nRegistrar must appoint Verifiers for every centre.\nFirm up Verification process. Shortlist the Verifiers and Registrar\u2019s supervisor. Schedule camps to educate verifiers.\nThe Registrar must ensure physical presence of verifiers during the operational hours of the enrolment centre and may appoint more than one Verifier in a centre, if and where required. The performance of Verifiers may be monitored by the Registrar.\nThe list of all Verifiers must be notified, by designation, by the Registrar before commencement of the enrolments and the list should be shared with the Regional office concerned.\nThey may be paid by the registrars out of the financial support provided by UIDAI to Registrars on successful Aadhaar generation. Roles and Responsibilities of Verifiers are defined by UIDAI.\n18. Personnel for Grievance Redressal\nThe registrar is expected to put in place a Team that would serve to quickly address any matters requiring resolution that may pertain to the Registrar, but may be conveyed to the UIDAI Contact Centre. The Time taken for resolutions is to be finalized jointly.\nRegistrar should also identify an Officer to whom all relevant grievances may be forwarded and two senior officers for managing escalations of the same.\n19. Print and Distribute Enrolment forms\nEnrolment form is designed by UIDAI for capturing Aadhaar enrolment data.\nRegistrar can have a separate form for capturing KYR+ data.\nRegistrar needs to get the enrolment forms printed in sufficient quantities.\nRegistrar must ensure that the forms are available/ distributed free of cost at the enrolment centres.\n20. Data Transfer\nFinalise, with EA, Resident Data packets transfer modalities. Data can be transferred to UIDAI using online SFTP mode or through hard disks/memory sticks sent through suitable courier service.\nAlso define KYR+ and registrar data packet transfer mode and frequency.\n21. For Document Management\nUIDAI mandates storage of Enrolment form, PoI, PoA, DoB, PoR, and consent. These documents carry important and confidential resident information.\nUIDAI urges to handle enrolment documents with care and protect it from damage and theft. Registrar must do the following:\nIdentify whether the documents would be stored in hard copy/soft, scanned copy\nSetup a mechanism for collecting and securely storing all the documents submitted by residents during enrolment till the UIDAI appointed DMS service provider collects document from registrar offices and provide receipt of the same.\nUpon accumulation of specified batches of documents at one site, intimate UIDAI\u2019s DMS service provider for pickup of documents, handover documents and obtain sign off. Detailed process and guidelines of Document management and Registrar\u2019s role in same are published by UIDAI in Document Management Process.\nIf Registrar wants to store any additional documents, they may develop their own process for storing and managing those documents.\n22. Provide requisite data to Contact Centre\nThe UIDAI has set up a Contact Centre for concern and issues that residents or UIDAI eco system partner may have in terms of enrolment, authentication and identity frauds etc. This contact centre serves as a single point of contact for the organization. Certain information is required by the contact centre, from the Registrar, related to enrolment exercise in their area. Registrars must furnish such details to the Contact centre to help effective functioning of the centre.\n23. Monitoring and Audits\nRegistrar is responsible for Field level execution, monitoring and audit.\nAudit enrolment centre readiness, EA processes and their effectiveness. It is recommended that Registrars setup a process to audit the performance of Enrolment Agencies and other partners they engage with.\nRegistrar must conduct sample audits in the entire gamut of enrolment process and data quality, training, logistics, grievance resolution and updation processes for controllership purposes.\nEnsure IEC norms are being adhered to. Advise EAs to deploy IEC elements in a judicious and practical manner. Monitor the performance of\nIntroducers and Verifiers.\nThe Registrar may also undertake appropriate measures such as monitoring of payment to operators\u2019 and supervisors\u2019 bank accounts, regular audits of EAs and enrolment centres, etc. to prevent sub-contracting.\nRandomly Review Acknowledgement and Consent data against PoI, PoA documents to ensure that data entered in the software is correct for each resident. In case any error is found in the data entered, inform the EA Supervisor and/or resident to initiate data correction.\n24. MIS\nRegistrar must develop their own MIS systems for execution, monitoring and control. Registrar may help provide UID with reports/insights in significant issues as and when required by UIDAI.\n25. Data Protection and Security Guidelines for Registrars\nRegistrars have a fiduciary responsibility and have to exercise a duty of care to secure and protect all the data (demographic and biometric) collected from the resident. UIDAI prescribes broad measures for data protection and security to be adopted by Registrars. Registrars must refer and abide by the same.\n26. Enforcement of UIDAI\u2019s suspension/debarment/dis-empanelment decisions\nUIDAI monitors the performance and data quality of Enrolment Agencies and their Operators and Supervisors on a continuous basis. UIDAI has formulated a suspension policy for non-compliant EAs and their Operators and Supervisors.\nRegistrar will be notified of the action where suspension/debarment/ dis-empanelment criteria are met. Registrars must get in touch with the UIDAI Regional Office and take immediate appropriate actions when intimated of such decisions.\n27. Enforcement of UIDAI\u2019s Returned Letters policy\nA report on returned letters will be shared by UIDAI with Registrars. Registrars must Review and investigate the various reason codes for Returned Letters. Where possible and required, Registrars may contact the Residents and educate residents on how to get in touch with contact centre for their Letters. Registrars may involve/take help from India Post in investigations.\n28. Ensure UIDAI Exit Policy requirements are fulfilled\nIf and when Registrar decides to exit the Aadhaar enrolment programme, they must fulfil requirements and sign necessary documents to meet the requirements of UIDAI\u2019s exit policy.\n\n"

        "The UIDAI has also defined a detailed Registrar Onboarding Process and Guide in order to support Registrars across the stages of becoming Aadhaar Ready. A high level summary of it is in this document:\n1. Setting Up Committees and Joint Working Groups\nSet up Apex/ Empowered Committee headed by CM and an Implementation Committee headed by Chief Secretary. It is recommended that UIDAI Regional Office and State UIDICs must coordinate with the State Registrars (SRs) and Non State Registrars (NSRs) in their States to increase accountability across stakeholders and facilitate the working of NSRs in tandem with SRs.\nIdentify Nodal Department for Aadhaar; Identify Departments which will act as Registrars along with a nodal Officer. Other Departments which are not included as Registrars in the project at the time of enrolment, will have the option of \u2018Aadhaar enabling\u2019 their systems at a later date. The Nodal and the Registrar departments can be the same department or different departments.\nEnsure MoU is signed\nIdentify Agency for Receiving financial assistance for enrolment: The UID Authority provides some financial support to its Registrars per successful enrolment into the UID system. To operationalise this arrangement, the Registrars will have to provide the details of the Registrar (name and account details) through which they would like to receive the amount.\nSetup Joint Working Group \u2013 headed by the Head of the Nodal/Registrar Dept. The other members should be Officers, who can lead the Technology, Process, IEC, Applications teams from the Registrar\u2019s side. UIDAI will nominate appropriate representatives to assist the State Government/Registrars in carrying through the entire process. Bank representatives may be included where the Financial Inclusion (FI) solution is a part of enrolment. Ensure smooth functioning and active participation of the working group during UIDAI \u2013 Registrar alignment.\nEnsure deliverables / project plan activities as mentioned in the UIDAI Registrar Readiness Checklist (RRC) are executed. Update RRC along with UIDAI nodal officer and EA at each stage. Hand over the signed checklist to Regional Office/Nodal Officer.\n2. Sensitization Workshops\nA series of sensitization workshops are held to provide an overview of Aadhaar, enrolment and IEC approach, roles and responsibilities at State/District/ Village levels, enrolment strategy and plans.\nThis will be followed by a set of sub-group workshops and meetings with members of the process, technology, IEC and applications teams respectively to identify the key areas of integration and implement the same. Ensure that Registrar\u2019s technology, process & IEC aspects are aligned with UIDAI.\nA \u201cGo Live readiness Workshop\u201d will be scheduled 2-3 weeks before scheduled \u2018go-live\u2019 date to take stock of the implementation status on items required to start enrolments. Registrar must advise UIDAI\u2019s focal point on modalities for setting up the on-boarding workshop and should ensure that the required stakeholders and members of working group attend the workshop.\nDefine the role of Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) in the enrolment process and develop a panel of CSOs at the local level who can help enrol marginalized communities. Social Inclusion is a mandatory requirement for registrars. Special enrolment drives should be initiated by registrars in consultation with ROs for the underprivileged, various vulnerable groups and disabled persons.\n"

        "\"Registrar\" is any entity authorized or recognized by the UID Authority for the purpose of enrolling the individuals for UID numbers. Registrars are typically departments or agencies of the State Government/Union territory, public sector undertakings and other agencies and organizations, who interact with residents in the normal course of implementation of some of their programs, activities or operations. Examples of such Registrars are Rural Development Department (for NREGS) or Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs Department (for TPDS), insurance companies such as Life Insurance Corporation and Banks.\nRegistrars will collect demographic & biometric data from residents directly or through Enrolment Agencies. Registrars have the flexibility to collect additional data, which will be referred to as \u2018KYR+\u2019 fields for the various applications they have in mind.\nThe UIDAI has developed standards, procedures and processes, guidelines and technology systems to execute the entire Aadhaar enrolment process which will be adhered to by the Registrars.

Further, it is possible to configure the Windows language input to assume a local language keyboard. This is not the same as transliteration, but assumes a different keyboard is being used \u2013 and the results are very different. UIDAI have also had difficulty in truly transliterating English words into local language, as they are very different from the language model. This can be better handled by using advanced facilities in the IMEs (for ex. Schemes in Google IME) The language support must be configured on a per user basis, and that makes it harder to manage."

        "Aadhaar seeding your scheme ensures that nobody else can claim your share of the benefits by impersonating you as a person. Also, in case of cash transfers, the money reaches directly to you Aadhaar linked bank account. You do not have to pursue different people to get the funds, besides you can decide which bank account you want to take money in. But all benefits go to your latest Aadhaar linked bank account. You cannot decide that one will go to one bank account and another one to the other bank account."
